# Exercise: write a program that has the following behavior:
#
# 1. when the program starts the user should be asked how many files are in the current directory.
# 2. then the user should be prompted for a guess.
# 3. If the user's answer is incorrect the user should be advised that the guess was either too low or too high.
# 4. then the user should be prompted to try to guess again.
# 5. If the user's guess is correct then they should be congratulated and the program should end.
#
# *. The program should not end until the user has entered the correct number of files in the current directory.
# *. The program should be able to be run by entering `bash xxx.sh` into the console.
# *. The program should contain at least one function, one loop, and one if statement.
# *. The program should be more than 20 lines of code but less than 50 lines of code.
