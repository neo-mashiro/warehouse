    <h1>Astrophysics</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Astrophysics</b> is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry "to ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects, rather than their positions or motions in space". Among the objects studied are the Sun, other
      stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background. Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density,
      temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists apply concepts and methods from many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum
      mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter, dark
      energy, and black holes; whether or not time travel is possible, wormholes can form, or the multiverse exists; and the origin and <b><em>ultimate fate of the universe</em></b>. Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar
      System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle
      physics.

    <h1>Computer Science</h1>
    <p>
      Computer science is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be represented as data in the form of programs. It enables the use of algorithms to manipulate, store, and communicate digital information. A computer scientist studies the
      theory of computation and the practice of designing software systems. Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. Computational complexity theory is highly abstract, while computer graphics emphasizes real-world applications.
      Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer programming itself involves the use of programming languages and complex systems. Human–computer interaction considers the challenges
      in making computers useful, usable, and accessible.
    </p>
    <h2>Contributions</h2>
    <p>
      Despite its short history as a formal academic discipline, computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society—in fact, along with electronics, it is a founding science of the current epoch of human history called the
      Information Age and a driver of the information revolution, seen as the third major leap in human technological progress after the Industrial Revolution (1750–1850 CE) and the Agricultural Revolution (8000–5000 BC). These contributions include:
    </p>
    <ul id="contrib">
      <li>The start of the "Digital Revolution", which includes the current Information Age and the Internet.</li>
      <li>A formal definition of computation and computability, and proof that there are computationally unsolvable and intractable problems.</li>
      <li>The concept of a programming language, a tool for the precise expression of methodological information at various levels of abstraction.</li>
      <li>In cryptography, breaking the Enigma code was an important factor contributing to the Allied victory in World War II.</li>
      <li>Scientific computing enabled practical evaluation of processes and situations of great complexity, as well as experimentation entirely by software. It also enabled advanced study of the mind, and mapping of the human genome became possible with
        the Human Genome Project. Distributed computing projects such as Folding@home explore protein folding.</li>
      <li>Algorithmic trading has increased the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets by using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other statistical and numerical techniques on a large scale. High frequency algorithmic trading can also
        exacerbate volatility.</li>
      <li>Computer graphics and computer-generated imagery have become ubiquitous in modern entertainment, particularly in television, cinema, advertising, animation and video games. Even films that feature no explicit CGI are usually "filmed" now on digital
        cameras, or edited or post-processed using a digital video editor.</li>
      <li>Simulation of various processes, including computational fluid dynamics, physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern
        computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are <b>SPICE</b>, as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes essential
        design software for integrated circuits.</li>
      <li>Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important as it gets more efficient and complex. There are many applications of AI, some of which can be seen at home, such as robotic vacuum cleaners. It is also present in video games and on the
        modern battlefield in drones, anti-missile systems, and squad support robots.
        <ul>
          <li>A hidden application which is too complicated to describe</li>
          <li>Another hidden application which is too complicated to describe</li>
          <li>One more hidden application which is too complicated to describe</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Human–computer interaction combines novel algorithms with design strategies that enable rapid human performance, low error rates, ease in learning, and high satisfaction. Researchers use ethnographic observation and automated data collection to
        understand user needs, then conduct usability tests to refine designs. Key innovations include the direct manipulation, selectable web links, touchscreen designs, mobile applications, and virtual reality.</li>

    <h1>Art and Music</h1>
    <p>
      I love music and art, but I have no talent for either. I am always reading something. My life’s ambition is to be able to finish my reading list, but I just keep adding to it. It’s a good problem to have. Sometimes I write if the stars are out and the
      moon is just right. Now I would like to recommend some books for you:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li class="book">History of Great Ancient Egypt</li>
      <li class="book">The Renaissance Artworks Collection</li>
      <li class="book">Life on a piece of A4 paper</li>
      <li class="book">50 most beautiful space cities on Mars</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I have a strong affection for Japanese animations where the stories are great and the character images are really fascinating, below is a sample illustration. This is hot-linked from the public domain so don't worry about storage and copyrights.

  	<h1>A Taste of JavaScript - Customize Interactive Elements</h1>
    <h2>From Wikipedia</h2>
    <p>
      As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features. JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
      <ol>
        <li class="book">HTML to define the content of web pages</li>
        <li class="book">CSS to specify the layout of web pages</li>
        <li class="book">JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language. JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design. JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997. ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language. W3Schools maintains a complete JavaScript reference, including all HTML and browser objects. The reference contains examples for all properties, methods and events, and is continuously updated according to the latest web standards.

    <h2>Canvas</h2>
    <p>
      A canvas is an extremely durable plain-woven fabric used for making sails, tents, marquees, backpacks, and other items for which sturdiness is required, as well as in such fashion objects as handbags, electronic device cases, and shoes. It is also popularly used by artists as a painting surface, typically stretched across a wooden frame.
    </p>
    <!-- canvas size must be defined in HTML rather than CSS, otherwise canvas will be stretched -->
    <canvas id="cvs" width="500" height="250"></canvas>

    <h2>Slider</h2>
    <p>
      In baseball, a slider is a breaking ball pitch that tails laterally and down through the batter's hitting zone; it is thrown with less speed than a fastball but greater than the pitcher's curveball. The break on the pitch is shorter than that of the curveball, and the release technique is 'between' those of a curveball and a fastball. The slider is similar to the cutter, a fastball pitch, but is more of a breaking ball than the cutter. The slider is also known as a yakker or a snapper.
    </p>

    <h2>Button</h2>
    <p>
      Some museums and art galleries hold culturally, historically, politically, and/or artistically significant buttons in their collections. The Victoria & Albert Museum has many buttons, particularly in its jewellery collection, as does the Smithsonian Institution. Hammond Turner & Sons, a button-making company in Birmingham, hosts an online museum with an image gallery and historical button-related articles, including an 1852 article on button-making by Charles Dickens. In the US, large button collections are on public display at the Waterbury Button Museum of Waterbury, Connecticut, the Keep Homestead Museum of Monson, Massachusetts, which also hosts an extensive button archive, and in Gurnee, Illinois at The Button Room.

    <h2>Color selector, checkbox and password</h2>
    <p>
      The security of a password-protected system depends on several factors. The overall system must be designed for sound security, with protection against computer viruses, man-in-the-middle attacks and the like. Physical security issues are also a concern, from deterring shoulder surfing to more sophisticated physical threats such as video cameras and keyboard sniffers. Passwords should be chosen so that they are hard for an attacker to guess and hard for an attacker to discover using any of the available automatic attack schemes. See password strength and computer security for more information.
